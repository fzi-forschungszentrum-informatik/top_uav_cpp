top_uav_cpp is a cpp tool  to generate time-optimal 3 dimensional trajectories from an initial position and velocity vector to a final postion and velocity vector with a constraint on the maximum velocity and acceleration for the entire motion.

## 💈 Installation
```shell
mkdir "build"
cd build
cmake ..
```


## 🍫 Quickstart
The example in main.cpp generates time-optimial trajectories according to the state-of-the-art method as well as of our basic generally valid version as well as our version with improved exploitation of kinematic properties.
